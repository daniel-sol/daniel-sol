- 👋 I'm Daniel Sollien
- 👀 I have a background from the oil and gas industry where I mostly worked with various topics within Monte Carlo simulation/stochastic modelling and data assimilation
-  🪡 I often ended up doing coding in python to sow things together, or for data analysis. Hence my interest in coding
-  👨🏽‍💻 From 2022-2024 I worked as a developer, where I worked in a DevOps team where we developed a cloud service for storage and fast retrieval of data from digital models
- 💞️ I have a strong interest in the green transitition, degrowth, and system dynamics, so I would love to work with something combining these interests with coding
- 🆓 Being interested in systems change I am convinced FOSS is the logical way
