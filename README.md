- 👋 I'm Daniel Sollien
- 👀 I work in the oil and gas industry where I mostly work with various topics within Monte Carlo simulation, like stochastic modelling and data assimilation.
-  Here I often end up doing coding in python to sow things together, or for data analysis
- 🌱 Besides that, Whenever I have the time, i try delve inbo the realm of machine learning and data science
- 💞️ I have a strong interest in the green transitition, degrowth, and system dynamics, so I would love to work with something combining these interests with coding. 
- I guess I have my doubts about degrowth and coding, but if anybody can prove me wrong, that would be something
