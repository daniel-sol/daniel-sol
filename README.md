- 👋 I'm Daniel Sollien
- 👀 I have a background from the oil and gas industry where I mostly worked with various topics within Monte Carlo simulation, stochastic modelling and data assimilation.
-  Here I often ended up doing coding in python to sow things together, or for data analysis
-  Last couple of years I worked as a developer. I worked in a DevOps team where we developed a cloud service for storage and fast retrieval of data from digital models
- 💞️ I have a strong interest in the green transitition, degrowth, and system dynamics, so I would love to work with something combining these interests with coding. 
- I guess I have my doubts about degrowth and coding, but if anybody can prove me wrong, that would be something
